## Constructor Functions in JavaScript

**Constructor functions** are a fundamental concept in JavaScript object-oriented programming. They're used to create objects with specific properties and methods.

### How Constructor Functions Work:
1. **Define the Function:** You create a function with a capitalized name (by convention) to indicate that it's a constructor.
2. **Use `this`:** Inside the function, you use the `this` keyword to refer to the newly created object.
3. **Assign Properties:** You assign properties to the object using `this`.
4. **Define Methods:** You can also define methods (functions within the object) using `this`.
5. **Create Instances:** To create new objects, you call the constructor function like a regular function.

### Example:
```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;

  this.greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  };
}

// Creating instances
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);
```

In this example:
* `Person` is the constructor function.
* `name` and `age` are properties assigned to the object.
* `greet` is a method defined on the object.
* `person1` and `person2` are instances of the `Person` constructor.

### Key Points:
* **Capitalization:** Constructor function names are typically capitalized to distinguish them from regular functions.
* **`new` Keyword:** The `new` keyword is used to create a new instance of the constructor function.
* **`this` Keyword:** `this` refers to the newly created object within the constructor function.
* **Prototypal Inheritance:** Objects created using constructor functions inherit properties and methods from their prototype.

### Additional Notes:
* **Class Syntax:** While constructor functions are a classic approach, ES6 introduced the `class` syntax as a more modern way to define objects and their properties. However, under the hood, classes are still implemented using constructor functions.
* **Object.create:** You can also create objects using `Object.create` to specify a prototype explicitly.

By understanding constructor functions, you can effectively create custom objects and organize your JavaScript code.
